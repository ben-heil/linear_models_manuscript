## Methods

### Data
**GTEx**  
We downloaded 17,382 TPM-normalized samples of bulk RNA-seq expression data from version 8 of GTEx to validate our results.
We then zero-one standardized the data and kept the 5000 most variable genes.
The tissue labels we used for the GTEx dataset were derived from the 'SMTS' column of the sample metadata file.

**Recount3**  
Our Recount3 dataset consisted of bulk RNA-seq data downloaded from the Recount3 compendium [@pmc:PMC86284] during the week of March 14, 2022.
Before filtering, the dataset contained 317,258 samples, each containing 63,856 genes.

To filter out single-cell data, we removed all samples with greater than 75 percent sparsity.
We also removed all samples marked 'scrna-seq' by Recount3's pattern matching method (stored in the metadata as 'recount_pred.pattern.predict.type').

We then converted the data to transcripts per kilobase million using gene lengths from BioMart [@pmc:PMC2649164] and performed standardization to scale each gene's range from zero to one.
We kept the 5,000 most variable genes within the dataset.

Samples were labeled with their corresponding tissues using the 'recount_pred.curated.tissue' field in the Recount3 metadata.
These labels were based on manual curation by the Recount3 authors.
A total of 20324 samples in the dataset had corresponding tissue labels.

Samples were also labeled with their corresponding sex using labels from Flynn et al. [@pmc:PMC8011224].
These labels were derived using pattern matching on metadata from the European Nucleotide Archive [@pmc:PMC3013801].
A total of 23,525 samples in our dataset had sex labels.

**Simulated data**  
We generated three simulated datasets.
The first dataset contained 1000 samples of 5000 features corresponding to two classes. 
2500 of those features contained linear signal.
That is to say that the feature values corresponding to one class were drawn from a standard normal distribution, while the feature values corresponding to the other were drawn from a Gaussian with a mean of 6 and unit variance.

The nonlinear features were generated similarly.
The values for the nonlinear features were drawn from a standard normal distribution for one class, while the second class had values drawn from either a mean 6 or mean -6 Gaussian with equal probability.
These features are referred to as "nonlinear" because two dividing lines are necessary to perfectly classify such data, while a linear classifier can only draw one such line per feature.

The second dataset was similar to the first dataset, but it consisted solely of 2500 linear features.
The final dataset contained only values drawn from a standard normal distribution regardless of class label.

### Model architectures
We used three representative models to demonstrate the performance profiles of different model classes.
Each model was implemented in Pytorch [@arxiv:1912.01703], used the same optimizer, and was trained for at most 50 epochs.

The nonlinear models were fully connected neural networks.
The first was a three layer network with hidden layers of size 2500 and 1250.
Our second was a five layer network, with hidden layers of size 2500, 2500, 2500, and 1250.
Both models used ReLU nonlinearities [@https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3104322.3104425].

The final model was an implementation of logistic regression, a linear model.
As there are known differences in performance between implementations of logistic regression [@pytorch_lr], we implemented ours in PyTorch as similarly to the neural nets as possible to allow for a fair comparison.

### Model training
**Optimization**  
Our models minimized the cross-entropy loss using an Adam [@arxiv:1412.6980] optimizer on minibatches of data.
They also used inverse frequency weighting to avoid giving more weight to more common classes.

**Regularization**  
The models used early stopping and gradient clipping to regularize their training.
Both neural nets used dropout [@https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html] with a probability of 0.5.
The deeper network used batch normalization [@https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ioffe15.html] to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

**Signal removal**  
We used Limma[@doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007] to remove linear signal associated with tissues in the data.
More precisely, we ran the 'removeBatchEffect' function from Limma on the training and validation sets separately, using the tissue labels as batch labels.

**Hyperparameters**  
The hyperparameters for each model during each run were selected via nested cross-validation over the training folds.

**Determinism**  
Model training was made deterministic by setting the Python, NumPy, and PyTorch random seeds for each run, as well as setting the PyTorch backends to deterministic and disabling the benchmark mode.

**Logging**  
Model training progress was tracked and recorded using Neptune [@neptune].

### Model Evaluation
In our analyses we use five-fold cross-validation with studywise data splitting.
In a studywise split, the studies are randomly assigned to cross-validation folds such that all samples in a given study end up in a single fold (fig. @fig:workflow bottom).

**Hardware**  
Our analyses were performed on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine and the Colorado Summit compute cluster.
The desktop CPU used was an AMD Ryzen 7 3800xt processor with 16 cores and access to 64 GB of RAM, and the desktop GPU used was an Nvidia RTX 3090.
The Summit cluster used Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPUs and NVidia Tesla K80 GPUs.
From initiating data download to finishing all analyses and generating all figures, the full Snakemake [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts480] pipeline took around one month to run.

**Recount3 tissue prediction**  
In the Recount3 setting the multitissue classification analyses were trained on the 21 tissues (see Supp. Methods) that had at least 10 studies in the dataset.
Each model was trained to determine which of the 21 tissues a given expression sample corresponded to.
The models' performance was then measured based on the balanced accuracy across all classes.

The binary classification setting was similar.
The five tissues with the most studies (brain, blood, breast, stem cell, and cervix) were compared against each other pairwise.
The expression used in this setting was the set of samples labeled as one of the two tissues being compared.

The data for both settings were split in a stratified manner based on study.

**GTEx classification**  
The multitissue classification analysis for GTEx used all 31 tissues.
Both the multiclass and binary settings were formulated and evaluated in the same way as in the Recount3 data.
However, rather than being split studywise, the data were stratified according to donor.

**Simulated data classification/sex prediction**  
The sex prediction and simulated data classification tasks were solely binary.
Both settings used balanced accuracy, as in the Recount3 and GTEx problems. 

**Pretraining**  
When testing the effects of pretraining on the different model types, we split the data into three sets.
Approximately forty percent of the data went into the pretraining set, forty percent went into the training set, and twenty percent went into the validation set.
The data was split such that each study's samples were in only one of the three sets, to simulate the real-world scenario where a model is trained on publicly available data then fine-tuned on a dataset of interest.

To ensure the results were comparable, we made two copies of each model with the same weight initialization.
The first copy was trained solely on the training data, while the second was trained on the pretraining data, then the training data.
Both models were then evaluated on the validation set.
This process was then repeated four more times with different studies assigned to the pretraining, training, and validation sets.
