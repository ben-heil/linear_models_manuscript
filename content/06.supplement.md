## Methods
### Recount3 tissues used
The tissues used from Recount3 were blood, breast, stem cell, cervix, brain, kidney, umbilical cord, lung, epithelium, prostate, liver, heart, skin, colon, bone marrow, muscle, tonsil, blood vessel, spinal cord, testis, and placenta.

### Data exploration
To determine whether our results were driven by an artifact in the data, we performed exploratory data analysis.
First, we looked for whether anything stood out when comparing per-sample performance between models.
Upon doing so, we found that TODO describe after running on all-tissue
When looking at the results, we noticed that some samples were consistently misclassified across models. 
We suspected it might be due to label imbalance, but a confusion matrix showed that not to be the case.
We examined the metadata for attributes that might be correlated with sample prediction hardness, and found that these samples tend to have a lower read quality than other samples.
