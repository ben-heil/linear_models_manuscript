## Introduction

- Deep learning is rapidly proving to be a great tool for a number of tasks in biology

- Being able to use DL to make predictions based on transcriptomic data is useful

- Ostensibly transcriptomics should be a domain where DL should work well; it has millions of publicly available samples, uniformly processed databases, and tons of metadata
- Lots of people do DL for transcriptomics

- But large head to head studies are rare

- In this paper we compare DL and linear methods directly 
- We do a massive head-to-head comparison (XX,000 trained models)

- Ultimately we find that neural nets are not significantly better than logistic regression
- These results suggests [too much complexity, data too small, data too noisy]
