## Introduction

- Being able to make predictions based on transcriptomic data is useful

- Deep learning is rapidly proving to be a great tool for prediction tasks with a lot of data across domains
- Ostensibly transcriptomics should be such a domain; it has millions of publicly available samples, uniformly processed databases, and tons of metadata
- Lots of people do DL for transcriptomics
- But large head to head studies are rare

- In this paper we compare DL and linear methods directly 
- We do a massive head-to-head comparison (XX,000 trained models)
- Ultimately we find that neural nets are not significantly better than logistic regression
- These results suggests [too much complexity, data too small, data too noisy]
