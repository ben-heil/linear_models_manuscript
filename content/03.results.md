## Results

### Linear and nonlinear models have similar performance in many tasks
We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear models across multiple datasets and tasks (fig. @fig:workflow top).
We examined using gene expression to predict tissue labels from GTEx [@doi:10.1038/ng.2653], tissue labels from Recount3 [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02533-6], and metadata-derived sex labels from Flynn et al. [@doi:10.1186/s12859-021-04070-2].
We filtered scRNA samples and also applied zero-one standardization after TPM normalization.
To avoid leakage between cross-validation folds, we placed entire studies into single folds (fig. @fig:workflow bottom).
We evaluated models on subsampled datasets to determine the extent to which performance was affected by the amount of training data.

We used GTEx [@doi:10.1038/ng.2653] to determine whether linear and nonlinear models performed similarly on a well-characterized dataset with consistent experimental protocols across samples.
We first trained our models to differentiate between tissue types on pairs of the five most common tissues in the dataset.
Likely due to the clean nature of the data, all models were able to perform perfectly on these binary classification tasks (fig. @fig:prediction_combined top right).
Because binary classification was unable to differentiate between models, we evaluated the models on a more challenging task.
We tested the models on their ability to perform multiclass classification on all 31 tissues present in the dataset.
In the multitask setting, logistic regression slightly outperformed the five-layer neural network, which in turn slightly outperformed the three-layer net (fig. @fig:prediction_combined top left).

We then evaluated the same approaches in a dataset with very different characteristics: Sequence Read Archive [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkq1019] samples from Recount3 [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02533-6].
We compared the models' ability to differentiate between pairs of tissues (supp. fig. @fig:recount-binary) and found their performance was roughly equivalent.
We also evaluated the models' performance on a multiclass classification problem differentiating between the 21 most common tissues in the dataset.
As in the GTEx setting, the logistic regression model outperformed the five-layer network, which outperformed the three-layer network (fig. @fig:prediction_combined bottom left). <!--in each of these cases where you are referring to a part of a figure, you should give it a label A, B, etc and use that -->

To examine whether these results held in a problem domain other than tissue type prediction, we tested performance on metadata-derived sex labels (fig. @fig:prediction_combined bottom right), a task previously studied by Flynn et al. [@doi:10.1186/s12859-021-04070-2].
We used the same experimental setup as in our other binary prediction tasks to train the models, but rather than using tissue labels we used sex labels from Flynn et al..
In this setting we found that while the models all performed similarly, the nonlinear models tended to have a slight edge over the linear one.

### There is predictive nonlinear signal in transcriptomic data
Our results to this point are consistent with a model where the predictive signal present in transcriptomic data is entirely linear.
If that were the case, nonlinear models like neural networks would fail to give any substantial advantage.
We first simulated three datasets to better understand model performance for a variety of linear or nonlinear data generating processes.
We created data with both linear and nonlinear signal by generating two types of features: half of the features with a linear dividing line between the simulated classes and half with a nonlinear dividing line (see [Methods](#methods) for more detail).
After training to classify the simulated dataset, all models effectively predicted the simulated classes.
To determine whether or not there was nonlinear signal, we then used Limma [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007] to remove the linear signal associated with the endpoint being predicted.
After removing the linear signal from the dataset, nonlinear models correctly predicted classes, but logistic regression performed no better than random (fig @fig:simulation middle).

To confirm that non-linear signal was key to the performance of non-linear methods, we generated another simulated dataset consisting solely of features with a linear dividing line between the classes.
As before, all models were able to predict the different classes well.
However, once the linear signal was removed, all models performed no better than random guessing (fig @fig:simulation left).
That the nonlinear models only achieved baseline accuracy also indicated that the signal removal method was not injecting nonlinear signal into data where nonlinear signal did not exist.

We also trained the models on a dataset where all features were Gaussian noise as a negative control.
As expected, the models all performed at baseline accuracy both before and after the signal removal process (fig. @fig:simulation right).
This experiment supported our decision to perform signal removal on the training and validation sets separately, as removing the signal in the full dataset introduced predictive signal (supp. fig. @fig:split-signal-correction).

We next removed linear signal from GTEx and Recount3.
We found that the neural nets performed better than the baseline while logistic regression did not (fig. @fig:signal_removed top right, supp. fig. @fig:recount-binary-combined).
Similarly, for multiclass problems logistic regression performing poorly, while the nonlinear models had performance that increased with an increase in data while remaining worse than before the linear signal was removed (fig. @fig:signal_removed left).
Likewise, the sex label prediction task showed a marked difference between the neural networks and logistic regression: only the neural networks could learn from the data (fig. @fig:signal_removed bottom right).
In each of the settings, the models performed less well when run on data with signal removed, indicating an increase in the problem's difficulty. 
Logistic regression, in particular, performed no better than random.

To verify that our results were not an artifact of our decision to assign studies to cross-validation folds rather than samples, we compared the study-wise splitting that we used with an alternate method called samplewise splitting.
Samplewise splitting (see [Methods](#methods)) is common in machine learning, but can leak information between the training and validation sets when samples are not independently and identically distributed among studies - a common feature of data in biology.
We found that sample-wise splitting induced substantial performance inflation (supp. fig. @fig:splitting).
The relative performance of each model stayed the same regardless of the data splitting technique, so the results observed were not dependent on the choice of splitting technique.

Another growing strategy in machine learning, especially on biological data where samples are limited, is training models on a general-purpose dataset and fine-tuning them on a dataset of interest.
We examined the performance of models with and without pretraining (supp. fig @fig:pretrain).
We split the Recount3 data into three sets: pretraining, training, and validation (fig. @fig:workflow bottom), then trained two identically initialized copies of each model.
One was trained solely on the training data, while the other was trained on the pretraining data and fine-tuned on the training data.
The pretrained models showed high performance even when trained with small amounts of data from the training set.
However, the nonlinear models did not have a greater performance gain from pretraining than logistic regression, and the balanced accuracy was similar across models.
