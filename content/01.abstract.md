## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Within the field of transcriptomic prediction there are two conflicting theories.
The first argues that the complexity of predicting phenotypes makes the task well-suited for complex nonlinear models such as neural networks.
The second believes that simpler models are better, as they are easier to interpret and have similar performance for some tasks.
By comparing neural networks and logistic regression across multiple prediction tasks on GTEx and Recount3 datasets, we were able to show that both theories are valid.
We demonstrated the presence of nonlinear signal in many transcriptomic prediction problems by removing the predictive linear signal with Limma.
However, we also found that the nonlinearity was not necessarily sufficient to cause neural networks to outperform logistic regression.
These results show that while there is potentially a use for neural networks in making predictions from gene expression data, including a linear baseline model is critical.
