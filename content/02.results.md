## Results

Format:

We wanted to find out to find X
So we did Y
We found Z

### Approach (or Constructing classifiers for expression data)
- Data splitting
- fivefold-CV
- three seeds
- Rund data on different subsets of training data (with full val data) to visualize model behavior across data levels (i.e. does model work well with little or lots of data)
- Retrain models to predict each fold via fivefold CV, reshuffle data and model inits with each seed
- Overall train 
- Maybe make a diagram?

### Linear and nonlinear models perform equivalently on metadata prediction tasks

- Binary tissue classification
- 21 class tissue classification

### This isn't because there is only linear signal in the data

- Pairwise tissue classification with label signal removed

### This isn't because tissue prediction is special

- Sex prediction

### This isn't because there is an obvious issue with the dataset

- Confusion matrix
- QC plot

### This is still true when there is data leakage as in common data splitting formats

- Maybe one sample-level plot, but mostly should be supplementary figures

### Pretraining doesn't save things (is this necessary?)

- Pretraining plots
